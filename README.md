# Project: Sales Overview Analysis Dashboard
# Business Requirement
This project involves designing a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track and analyze key sales metrics Sales, Profit, and Quantity across four different regions: Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard is designed to enable users to filter by year and toggle between the three metrics, providing insights into trends and comparisons with the previous year (PY) for each selected year.
# Key Features
- Dynamic Filtering & Metric Selection: Users can filter the data by year and choose between three key metricsâ€”Sales, Profit, and Quantity for each region.
- Year-on-Year Comparison: The dashboard compares the selected year's metrics with the previous year's (PY) data.
- Interactive Visualizations: Includes sparkline bar charts to visualize monthly trends with an average line for better trend analysis across the regions.
# Region-Specific Requirements
- Central Region:
Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity based on the selected year.
Allow dynamic selection between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
Show Sales data for the previous year based on the selected year filter.
Create a bar sparkline to analyze monthly data, with an average line for trend insights.
- East Region:
Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity based on the selected year.
Allow dynamic selection between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
Show Sales data for the previous year based on the selected year filter.
Create a bar sparkline to analyze monthly data, with an average line for trend insights.
- South Region:
Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity based on the selected year.
Allow dynamic selection between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
Show Sales data for the previous year based on the selected year filter.
Create a bar sparkline to analyze monthly data, with an average line for trend insights.
- West Region:
Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity based on the selected year.
Allow dynamic selection between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
Show Sales data for the previous year based on the selected year filter.
Create a bar sparkline to analyze monthly data, with an average line for trend insights.
# Chart Requirements
# Sales by State:
- Bubble Map: Visualize sales distribution across different states with a bubble map. The size of each bubble corresponds to sales volume, making it easy to spot regions with high or low sales performance.
- Bar Chart: A detailed bar chart accompanies the bubble map to break down sales by state, allowing for a clear comparison between states, sorted in either ascending or descending order.
# Conclusion
This dynamic Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive analysis of sales performance across various regions and metrics, with easy-to-read visualizations and year-over-year comparisons. It is designed to give stakeholders valuable insights into sales trends and performance in a flexible and user-friendly interface.
